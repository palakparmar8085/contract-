# ChainFlux

## 🚀 Project Description
ChainFlux is a lightweight blockchain-based task management system built on Ethereum.  
It introduces a simple and transparent structure for creating, tracking, and completing project tasks using smart contracts.

## 🌐 Project Vision
ChainFlux aims to evolve into a modular project management ecosystem powered by decentralized infrastructure.  
By enabling trustless task tracking, ChainFlux envisions a future where collaborative work can be verified transparently on-chain.

## ⭐ Key Features
- **Task Creation** – Add tasks directly to the blockchain with title and description.  
- **Task Retrieval** – Fetch task details from the contract, ensuring transparency.  
- **Completion Tracking** – Mark tasks as completed with immutable on-chain records.  
- **Owner Control** – Only the contract owner can manage tasks for added security.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with a frontend dashboard (React/Next.js).  
- Role-based task access (contributors, managers, auditors).  
- IPFS integration for rich task metadata.  
- Tokenized rewards for task completion.  
- Layer-2 deployment for faster and cheaper transactions.
